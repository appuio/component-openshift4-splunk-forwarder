= Create Fluentd Certificate

To create an SSL certificate for the splunk-forwarder use this command and answer the questions like in the example below.

[source,shell]
----
export INSTANCE_NAME=splunk-forwarder-customer-a <1>
openssl req  -nodes -new -x509 -days 3650 -keyout server.key -out server.cert -subj /name=${INSTANCE_NAME}.openshift-logging.svc
----
<1> Set `INSTANCE_NAME` to the name you're instantiating the component with.


== Upload Private Key to Vault

Create or update the secret in Vault.

TIP: You need to be logged in to Vault for the commands to work.

[source,shell]
----
# Adjust to your environment
instance=#INSTANCE_NAME
key="clusters/kv/${TENANT_ID}/${CLUSTER_ID}/openshift4-splunk-forwarder/${instance}/fluentd"

# Query for existing secrets first
vault kv get "${key}"

# If there are existing secrets, add your instance secrets:
vault kv patch "${key}" privatekey=$(cat server.key)

# If there is no pre-existing secret, create new:
vault kv put "${key}" privatekey=$(cat server.key)
----
